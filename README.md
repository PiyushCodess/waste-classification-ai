# AI-Based Waste Classification System

This project is an AI-powered waste classification system that identifies whether waste is **Organic** (biodegradable) or **Recyclable** (non-biodegradable) from images. The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deployed with Streamlit for easy web access.

## Features

- Classifies waste images into Organic or Recyclable
- Simple web interface for uploading and testing images
- Helps promote proper waste segregation and environmental awareness

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras (for CNN model)
- Streamlit (for web app)
- NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow (for image processing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/waste-classification-ai.git
   cd waste-classification-ai
